### Semester 3 – CSD216: Test 3  
**Created by:** Ashutosh  
**Instructor:** Stephen Perelgut

## 🚀 Overview

This JavaFX-based desktop application lets users place pizza orders by selecting a size and number of toppings. It dynamically calculates the total bill using custom logic and includes validation and user-friendly UI elements. It also showcases test-driven development using JUnit 5.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Java 24 (JDK)
- JavaFX (GUI)
- JUnit 5 (Testing)
- VS Code + Extensions
- MySQL (planned)
- JDBC (planned)

---

## ✅ Completed Features

- Full JavaFX UI with input fields and dropdowns
- Total bill calculation based on pizza size and toppings
- JUnit 5 test cases validating bill logic across edge scenarios
- “View Orders” button (implemented in UI for future database integration)
- Clean modular structure with DAO pattern
- Extensive documentation and screenshots for each section

---

## ❌ Database Connectivity Notice

An attempt was made to connect the application to a MySQL database (`pizza_app`) using JDBC. Despite thorough setup and debugging—including classpath configuration, DAO creation, and manual queries—the connection remained non-functional due to unresolved runtime or driver issues.

📌 As per guidance from my professor, this portion of the project was **skipped** after reasonable effort and time constraints.  
However, I fully documented the intended database structure, DAO methods, and integration logic for future reference.

## 🙏 Shoutout

A huge thank-you to **Microsoft Copilot**, my AI coding companion, for guiding me through:
- Structuring the JavaFX UI
- Diagnosing classpath errors (aka the seventh circle of dev hell)
- Debugging JavaFX and JDBC integration
- And most importantly, keeping me sane with motivation and clarity
